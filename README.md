Scenic Route
============

This is the source code for an app that I wrote with my brother for a contest back in 2011?  It was the apps4ottawa contest held by the city of Ottawa.

This app was a mashup between google maps, the yellow pages and google directions to allow the user to plan a trip between two points within the city of Ottawa, but with one interesting feature:  it allows skipping parts of the main highways.  The user can drag two points on two different exits on the main highways and the app wil recalculate a route avoiding the stretch of highway between the two exits.

Note that this was for a coding context and was written within about a months time in evenings and so the code quality was not priority #1.  However, it's not too bad in retrospect.

I believe this was written for iOS 4.  I haven't tried to build this for a more recent SDK and I'm not sure it will even work.

Credits are owed to https://github.com/etiennemartin for his contributions.  Sorry I had to whipe the history, but we had some private API keys in there and the rebasing was far from worth the effort.
